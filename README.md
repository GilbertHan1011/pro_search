# Pro-search : Highly Efficient Protein Sequence Retrieval

Pro-search is a highly efficient, BLAST-like protein sequence search tool written in Rust. It implements a full-stack bioinformatics pipeline—from $k$-mer indexing to Smith-Waterman local alignment—designed to explore the trade-offs between search speed, sensitivity, and memory usage.
